# Graph_Theory_Assignment

This repository is made for my Graph Theory module for university.  The objective
of it is to demonstrate and explain what Heap Sort is and to explain the Graph 
Isomorphism Problem.  It consists of two Jupyter Notebooks:
  1. heap-sort.ipynb
  2. graph-isomorphism.ipynb

How do you run it?
1.  Clone this repo onto your computer using git clone "https://github.com/jcoolbeing/Graph_Theory_Assignment"
2.  Open a terminal (for example cmd or windows terminal)
3.  enter "cd" (change directory) to the cloned folder from github
4.  enter jupyter notebook into your terminal and then wait for a browser to pop up
5.  then you should be able to select the notebooks displayed in the web browser
