    "What is it?\n",
    "Heap sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm invented by J. W. J. Williams in 1964.  It is very similar to selection \n",
    "sort as it also divides itself into sorted and unsorted regions and moves the highest number from the latter into sorted.\n",
    "By storing the unsorted region inside of a heap structure rather than doing linear searches a lot of time can be saved.\n",
    "Heap sort almost always works at O (n log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How does it work?\n",
    "In Heap Sort you either sort in ascending or descending order.  This is called min-heap for ascending and max-heap for \n",
    "descending order.  The first step is to construct a binary heap with its index being its root node.  Every node except \n",
    "for the root has a parent node.  The second step is to keep taking out the largest or lowest number depending on which\n",
    "order you selected from the heap and inserting it into a sorted array."
